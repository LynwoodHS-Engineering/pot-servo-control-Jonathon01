The code has #include <Servo.h> and Servo myservo; so it knows we're working with servos. We have the initial set up of potpin = A0, 
one of the wires from the potentiometer is connected to A0 so it can be read. The servoattach has pin9 because the signal pin is 
connected to the 9th pin, then the serial so we can read stuff in the serial board. Moving on from the initial, we have val which
will read the analogPin of potpin and we need a sensorvalue to read the potentiometer. we have a map for val now as it needs the
minimum and maximum values for our two things. Finally, we have the print commands to format it correctly in the serial board with 
the delay so it doesn't break the screen with piles of numbers.
